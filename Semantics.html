                <h2> Fun Cake Facts</h2>
                <p>Here are some fun and interesting cake facts for you:</p>
                
                <p>1. **The First Cake**: The earliest cakes were actually more bread-like, sweetened with honey and baked with nuts or
                dried fruits. They were more like a bread or pastry than the modern fluffy cake we know today.</p>
                
               <p> 2. **The Invention of Cake Mix**: The first boxed cake mix was introduced in the 1930s by a company called Betty
                Crocker. It made baking a cake easier, as all you had to do was add water and eggs. The mix became incredibly popular
                during WWII when resources were scarce.</p>
                
               <p>3. **Birthday Cakes**: The tradition of birthday cakes dates back to Ancient Greece. The Greeks would make round cakes
                to honor the moon goddess Artemis. The cakes were decorated with candles to make them glow like the moon.</p>
                
               <p> 4. **Largest Cake Ever**: The world's largest cake ever baked was in 2005 in Alabama, USA. It weighed over 128,000
                pounds (58,000 kg), and it took 2,000 volunteers to create.</p>
                
               <p> 5. **Cake in Space**: In 2016, NASA sent a specially engineered "space cake" to the International Space Station. The
                cake was freeze-dried and stored in a vacuum-sealed bag to allow astronauts to enjoy a slice in zero gravity.</p>
                
                6. **Cake as Art**: Modern cake decorating has become a huge art form. Elaborate cakes are often designed to look like
                intricate works of art, from hyper-realistic flowers to cakes shaped like cars, castles, and even people.
                
              <p>Cake is not just a delicious treat; itâ€™s also part of many rich traditions and fun facts!</p>
